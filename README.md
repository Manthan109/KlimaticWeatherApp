# Klimatic

A new Flutter project.
This app is an example of parsing JSON API .
I have used OpenWeatherMap JSON API to get weather information.
This app is just a general weather app to get info like minimum and maximum temperature , humidity and current temperature.
Here are the screenshots of the screens of how the app looks-
